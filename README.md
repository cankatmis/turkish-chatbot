# turkish-chatbot
Turkish Chatbot is a Node.js and Flutter application that uses ChatGPT API and DeepL API to provide a Turkish chatbot experience. Users can enter messages in Turkish, which are translated to English using DeepL API. The translated message is then sent to ChatGPT API to generate a response, which is translated back to Turkish using DeepL API.
